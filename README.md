# weatherapp
# source code can be found in master branch
# open project folder and switch to master branch in visual studio code where source code can be found
# open the project directory via the terminal window and type command-> npm install 
# it downloads all the dependency in the project
# to run the app write a command -> npm start
# it will open in a browser via http://localhost:3000
# since the weather icons folder should be present in the dependencies folder ie on the node_modules folder that gets created once you download the download the dependencies for this project. we can then download the weather icons that this app can access from here https://github.com/erikflowers/weather-icons.git .
# you can download it via a teminal using npm https://github.com/erikflowers/weather-icons.git which it will place the folder on node_modules folder
or download it explicitly and place it in a node-modules folder renaming the folder exactly what is in a code.
